# Contributing

Use the standard

1. fork
2. branch

## Hacking on it

You'll need:

- gulp (`npm install -g gulp`)
- bundler (`gem install bundler`)

Pull down the repo, and run `bundle install` and `npm install`.
To run the Jekyll server, run `gulp dev`. The Jekyll files are in `site/`.
Before you commit, make sure and run `gulp` (the default task) so that
everything gets updated before you check it in.

\* Make sure you only run `gulp` in the project root.
